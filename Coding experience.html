    <div>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        Welcome to my website, my name is Harry and here is a brief summary of my experience in self taught 
    computer programming</p>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">The languages I've prioritised learning are</p>
    <ul style="color: aliceblue;">
    <li>Hyper Text Markup Language (HMTL)</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="flex-container" style="color: aliceblue;">Through a variety of online resources, such as CodeCademy and CodeBar, I have 
        committed to teaching myself the basics of the above languages.</p>
        <img src="Images source/codebar logo.jpg" id="CodeBar"></img>
        <img src="Images source/CODECADEMY LOGO.jpg" id="CODECADEMY"></img>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">I have utilised all three of these in this webpage as a demonstration of my
    growth in knowledge as I am passionate about progressing into a career involving this exciting skillset 
    through a beginner level position, whether through a programming apprenticeship run at my current workplace: </p> 
    <p style="color:aliceblue" id="AmEx">American Express</p>
    <p style="color: aliceblue;">Or as an entry level programmer outside of AmEx where I can embrace the excitement of a new place to showcase my potential!</p>

    <h2 style="color: aliceblue;">My Interests</h2>
    <p>While I'm relativley new to the world of Computer Prgramming Languages, so far I've found an interest in 
        web design. Being a visual learner, I've developped an enthusiasm for expanding on the above langages to grow
        my abilities in this field. </p>

    <h3 style="color: aliceblue;">Inviting the user</h3>
    <div>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">
        A good webiste is one that a user can interact with and enjoy themselves doing so.</p>
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">Because of this, interactivity is a handy tool. 
        This is where the language of JavaScript comes in! JavaScript offers us options to add a variety of 
    funtions and interactions within our code, and therefore our webpage.</p>
    </div>
<div style="color: aliceblue;">
    <h4>Learning User Input</h4>
    <p>Below are two buttons I've created to demonstate how the use of JavaScript can allow a website to present
        as more than just text and images and instead be interated with.</p>
    <p>Try clicking them, see what happens!</p>
    <button id="Bluebutton">Change to Blue!</button>
    <button id="Redbutton">Change to Red!</button>
    </p>
<p>Very simple obviously...but these two buttons added something to do other than just read text 
    and images.
</p>
<p>Especially important since a single bright red button hardly fits this pages colour scheme!</p>
